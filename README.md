- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Yulia Tyukhova @ytyukhova.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in projects that integrate research, data, design, and technology. 
- :low_brightness: My background is in the Lighting industry - a unique industry with professionals of various backgrounds such as Architectural Engineering, Architecture, Electrical Engineering, Interior Design, Arts, and so on. My background includes research on lighting quality and the effects of lighting on human perception. In particular I investigate negative glaring effects of light sources on human perception. This knowledge is used in writing standards; for measuring, assesing, and predicting negative effects of a lighting installation; and for the improvements of the light-source designs and our environments. 
- :chart_with_upwards_trend: I am interested in data analytics and elements of data science. I enjoy learning from data and base decisions supported by data. I am also interested in understanding the big picture that cannot always be measured.
