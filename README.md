- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Yulia Tyukhova @ytyukhova.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in projects that integrate research, data, design, and technology. 
- :low_brightness: My background is in the Lighting industry - a quite unique industry to which professionals come from various fields such as Electrical Engineering, Architectural Engineering, Architecture, Interior Design, Arts, etc. I have a PhD in Architectural Engineering â€“ Lighting from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. My background includes research on lighting quality and the effects of lighting on human perception. In particular I investigated negative glaring effects of light sources on human perception. This knowledge can be used in measuring negative effects of a lighting installation and for the improvements of the light-source designs. 
- :chart_with_upwards_trend: I am interested in data analytics and elements of data science. I enjoy learning from data and base decisions on as much information as possible. I am also interested in understanding the big picture that cannot always be measured.
